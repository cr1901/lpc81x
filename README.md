# Caveats

The SVD file provided by NXP appears to be autogenerated, and contains a number of bugs:

* Some reset values are incorrect compared to the LPC81x datasheet (UM10601.pdf from NXP).
Determined by trial and error.
* Register field names ("bit ranges grouped by purpose") and associated enumerations 
(i.e. "names for the valid bit values for the bit range") are automatically generated
from descriptions, up to 31 characters (using underscore for spaces).
* Reserved register fields should be omitted or use an identifier called `RESERVED` 
([case insensitive](https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/SVD/html/svd_Format_pg.html)).
NXP opts to include these fields in their SVD file, but some register fields append
an underscore and possibly number to the `RESERVED` identifier.

The latter two problems result in unusable, duplicate, and/or ambiguous enum identifiers
for writing/reading registers using the device crate.  `svd2rust` cannot detect
this and allows unsafe raw bit writes to a register field using a safe API.
Some registers (such as GPIO) don't have fields at all, requiring unsafe writes when it's
known apriori that any value written to these registers is safe. I would apprecate any
help in improving the SVD file prior to API generation. _Please increment the patch version
by 1 for each group of related changes._
